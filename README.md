## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher)

- A registered Evzone Africa merchant account (to obtain necessary credentials).

## Installation
To install the `evzone-alb` library, run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npm install pay-sdk-tx5
```
## Usage

### Frontend (React)

1. Import the `WalletPaymentForm` component into your React application.
2. Use it within a conditional render to show the payment form when needed (e.g., in a popup or modal).
3. Pass the required props: `customerId`, `amount`, `onClose`, and `onSuccess`.
4. Pass additional props to customize the transaction: `type`, `particulars`, `currency`, `merchantName`, and `merchantLogo`.

Hereâ€™s an example usage in a shopping cart component:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import WalletPaymentForm from "pay-sdk-tx5/dist/WalletPaymentForm.esm";

const Cart = () => {
  const [showPopup, setShowPopup] = useState(false);
  const cartTotalAmount = 99.99; // Example amount (replace with your cart logic)
  const customerId = "customer123"; // Example customer ID (replace with your auth logic)

  // Transaction details to pass to WalletPaymentForm
  const transactionType = "Cart Purchase";
  const transactionParticulars = "Purchase of Shirt, Pants"; // Example: Dynamically generate based on cart items
  const transactionCurrency = "USD";
  const merchantName = "My Awesome Store";
  const merchantLogo = "https://example.com/merchant-logo.png"; // Replace with your merchant logo URL

  const handlePaymentSuccess = () => {
    console.log("Payment successful");
    // Add logic to clear cart or update order status
    setShowPopup(false);
  };

  const handlePaymentClose = () => {
    console.log("Payment popup closed");
    setShowPopup(false);
  };

  return (
    <div className="cart-container">
      <h2>Shopping Cart</h2>
      <button onClick={() => setShowPopup(true)}>Make Payments</button>
      {showPopup && (
        <WalletPaymentForm
          customerId={customerId}
          amount={cartTotalAmount}
          type={transactionType}
          particulars={transactionParticulars}
          currency={transactionCurrency}
          merchantName={merchantName}
          merchantLogo={merchantLogo}
          onClose={handlePaymentClose}
          onSuccess={handlePaymentSuccess}
        />
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default Cart;
```
## Configuration

The `WalletPaymentForm` component supports the props listed in the API Reference. You can customize the transaction details and merchant branding by passing the optional props (`type`, `particulars`, `currency`, `merchantName`, `merchantLogo`). Additional customization (e.g., theming, additional fees) may be added in future updates. Check the latest documentation or release notes for updates.
